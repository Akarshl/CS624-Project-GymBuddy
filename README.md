# GymBuddy - A Fitness Tracker Mobile App

**GymBuddy** is a full-stack fitness tracking mobile application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React Native, and Node.js). It is designed to help users track their workouts and meal plans, visualize progress, and manage settingsâ€”all from a user-friendly mobile interface.

## Input

The application requires user input primarily through the mobile interface. Users can:
- Add new workouts by entering workout names.
- Add meals or nutrition items for their daily diet plans.
- Modify toggle-based settings like notifications or dark mode.
- (In the future) Log in with credentials to access a personalized experience.

Data entered by the user is sent to the backend via HTTP requests and stored in a MongoDB database. Workouts and meals are retrieved dynamically from the database and displayed using interactive UI components.

##  Features

- **Workout Tracker**: Users can view a list of workouts and add new ones dynamically. Workouts are stored in MongoDB and synced live with the app using REST APIs.
- **Nutrition Planner**: Users can track meals and dietary plans, add new entries, and update them, with all changes reflected in real-time from the database.
- **Home Dashboard**: Visual representation of weekly progress using a line chart and motivational quotes for encouragement.
- **Settings Panel**: Toggle dark mode, enable or disable notifications, and log out of the app. The logout button refreshes the app and redirects the user to the login page.
- **Login Page**: Handles basic access to the app, enabling future authentication logic.
- **Cloud-hosted Backend**: Using GitHub Codespaces or similar environments, the backend API is served through a development tunnel and connected to MongoDB.

## Process

The app follows a clear modular architecture:

1. **Frontend (React Native with Expo Router)**:
   - Built with a stack-based navigation using `expo-router`.
   - Components like `Workouts`, `Nutrition`, `Settings`, and `Home` are organized under the `app/` directory.
   - Uses `axios` for communicating with the backend and fetching or submitting data.
   - FlatList, Buttons, LineCharts, and Alert APIs are used to render dynamic UI and manage interactivity.

2. **Backend (Express + Node.js)**:
   - A REST API built with Express handles GET and POST requests for `/api/workouts` and `/api/meals`.
   - MongoDB is used as the database to store and retrieve workouts and meal data.
   - Dummy data is inserted into the database on setup to simulate user content.

3. **Deployment**:
   - The backend is run in GitHub Codespaces and exposed using its port forwarding feature.
   - The frontend mobile app connects to the backend using this forwarded public URL.

## Output

Upon using the app, users see a clean and responsive mobile interface with:
- A motivational dashboard and progress chart on the home screen.
- A scrollable list of workouts or meal plans retrieved from the database.
- Instant ability to add new workouts or meals, with backend syncing.
- A functional settings page where they can toggle preferences and securely log out.
- After logout, the app resets state and navigates the user back to the login page for fresh access.

This setup enables a seamless full-stack mobile experience that can be extended for advanced features like authentication, progress history, goal tracking, and push notifications.
